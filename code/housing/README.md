# EMRP19: Housing documentation
Environmental Monitoring Reasearch Project WS19/20 to monitor fill-level of trash bins in the city of Moers using LoRa technology

The housing has been designed using Autodesk Fusion 360. In order to guarantee the
best fitting possible and the highest precision, a 3D model of the battery holder was used and imported
into the design of the housing. 


### General specifications
The housing is measuring 180mm x 47mm x 27mm and was 3d-printed using PLA filament. 
PLA (Polylactide) was used, because it is on one hand immensely stabile, but on the other hand also biodegradable.
The housing is completely modular. It is designed in a way, such that it is possible to use it in numerous ways. 
One half of the housing is used for the power supply, where there is room for a battery holder for two 18650 batteries.
The other half is used for the electronics. Here, any pcb with a maximum size of 78mm x 43mm can be placed and fixed. 
This approach is making the housing extremely versatile.  

### Mounting positions
In order to mount the housing on the trash bin, six neodymium magnets were fixed on the bottom side of the housing. 
This was accomplished by adding six offsets a 1mm bigger in diameter and half as thick as the magnets, which guarantees that the magnets stand 
out and therefore have direct contact to the trash bin.

The shape as well as the dimensions of the housing make multiple mounting positions possible. For example, the device can be mounted 
in the door of the trash bin or under an interior edge. Both options have the common advantage, such that it is possible to hide the device
in order to protect it from external influences. 

All in all, the current version of the housing is making a lot of customization possible. 
Therefore, it is possible to extend the battery life by enlarging the side of the power supply. 
As soon as final requirements were discussed with ENNI, the housing can be finalized.
